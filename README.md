Welcome to our web application, Fuel Up!

- Fuel Up has users enter in their address and choose the type of fueling station they are looking for. Once they click Submit, they are presented with the closest 10 results.

- User just got spouse an electric vehicle and is still truckinâ€™ down the highway with gasoline under the hood. The couple wants a quick way for drivers in either vehicle to find the closest charging station, especially in a bind when their fuel is low. -
